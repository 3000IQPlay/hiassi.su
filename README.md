# hiassi.su

first minecraft client i pasted, just were training my java skills for like 2 months and learning shit on this project.
client is fully shit but better than the original trollgod i used as a base i guess, anyways nobody will use this so it doesnt matter.

# how

to build use 
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew build

then go build/libs and there youll see the jar thingy

or just download the release if im not being lazy to build and publish it myself
